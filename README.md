# Hardlink Creator
This script creates hardlinks of files chosen by the user in Windows.

This script has 2 steps: 
1. The script first asks the user to choose all the files of which a hardlink should be created.
2. The script asks the user to choose the location of the hardlinks. 

When multiple files are chosen in step 1, all hardlinks will be placed at the location chosen in step 2.

## How to use
Run the executable file "hardlink_creator.exe".

OR

Run "python hardlink_creator.py" in the terminal.
